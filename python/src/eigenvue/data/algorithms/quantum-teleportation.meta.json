    "short": "Teleport a qubit state using entanglement and classical communication.",
    "long": "Quantum teleportation is a protocol that transfers an unknown quantum state from one party (Alice) to another (Bob) using a pre-shared entangled Bell pair and two classical bits of communication. It does not transmit matter or energy faster than light \u2014 the classical bits must travel through a normal channel. The protocol exploits three key ideas: (1) Bell pairs provide maximally entangled resources shared between Alice and Bob; (2) the no-cloning theorem forbids copying an unknown quantum state, so teleportation necessarily destroys Alice\u2019s original; (3) LOCC (local operations and classical communication) suffices to reconstruct the state on Bob\u2019s side. Alice entangles her unknown qubit with her half of the Bell pair via a CNOT and Hadamard, then measures both qubits, obtaining two classical bits. She sends these bits to Bob, who applies a conditional correction (X and/or Z gates) to his half of the Bell pair. After correction, Bob\u2019s qubit is in the exact state Alice started with \u2014 verified on the Bloch sphere. Teleportation is the foundation of quantum repeaters, quantum networks, and measurement-based quantum computation."
