## How to Cite

If you use Eigenvue in your research, teaching, or academic publications, please cite it using the following BibTeX entry:

```bibtex
@article{eigenvue2026,
  title = {Eigenvue: A Visual Learning Platform for Algorithms, AI Architectures, and Quantum Computing},
  author = {Mishra, Ashutosh},
  journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},
  year = {2026},
  url = {https://eigenvue.web.app},
  doi = {<pending>}
}
```

The DOI will be updated once the JOSS review process is complete. In the meantime, the URL `https://eigenvue.web.app` serves as the canonical reference.

## CITATION.cff

A machine-readable citation file is maintained at the repository root as [`CITATION.cff`](https://github.com/eigenvue/eigenvue/blob/main/CITATION.cff). This file follows the [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) standard and is automatically rendered by GitHub on the repository landing page. When visitors click the "Cite this repository" button on GitHub, they receive a pre-formatted citation derived from this file.

The `CITATION.cff` file includes all author metadata, the software version, license information, and links to the project homepage. If you need to cite a specific version of Eigenvue, refer to the version field in the `CITATION.cff` file or use the DOI associated with that release.

## Academic Use

Eigenvue is released under the **MIT License**, which permits free use, modification, and redistribution in both academic and commercial settings. There are no restrictions on using Eigenvue in coursework, research papers, presentations, or derivative educational tools.

We encourage citation not as a legal requirement but as a way to:

- **Support open-source sustainability** -- citations help demonstrate impact, which supports continued development and funding.
- **Enable reproducibility** -- citing the specific version used in a study allows others to reproduce results.
- **Build the community** -- citations help other researchers and educators discover the tool.

If you use Eigenvue in a publication, we would appreciate it if you let us know. We maintain a list of publications and courses that use Eigenvue, and we are happy to feature your work.
