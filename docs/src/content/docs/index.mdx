## What Is Eigenvue?

Eigenvue is an **open-source platform** for visualizing algorithms across four domains:
classical algorithms, deep learning, generative AI, and quantum computing. It is
distributed as two products:

- **Web Application** at [eigenvue.web.app](https://eigenvue.web.app) — interactive visualizations in the browser, shareable via deep links.
- **Python Package** via `pip install eigenvue` — visualizations in Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and research workflows.

Both products share the same algorithm definitions and produce identical visualizations.
The platform currently includes **22 algorithms** with step-by-step execution,
synchronized code highlighting, plain-language explanations, and educational content.

## Algorithm Domains

| Domain | Algorithms | Accent |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Classical** | Binary Search, Bubble Sort, QuickSort, Merge Sort, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra | Blue |
| **Deep Learning** | Perceptron, Feedforward Network, Backpropagation, Convolution, Gradient Descent | Purple |
| **Generative AI** | Tokenization (BPE), Token Embeddings, Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention, Transformer Block | Pink |
| **Quantum Computing** | Qubit Bloch Sphere, Quantum Gates, Superposition & Measurement, Grover's Search, Quantum Teleportation | Cyan |
