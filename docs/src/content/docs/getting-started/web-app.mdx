---

Eigenvue runs entirely in your browser -- no installation, no signup, no friction.
Open [eigenvue.web.app](https://eigenvue.web.app) and start exploring.

## Opening the App

Navigate to [eigenvue.web.app](https://eigenvue.web.app). The landing page gives you a
brief overview of the platform and a direct link to the algorithm catalog. There
is no account creation step; every visualization is available immediately.

## Browsing Algorithms

The catalog lives at [`/algorithms`](https://eigenvue.web.app/algorithms). From
here you can discover all 22 algorithms organised into four categories:

| Category | Count | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Classical** | 7 | Sorting, graph traversal, dynamic programming |
| **Deep Learning** | 5 | Transformers, CNNs, RNNs |
| **Generative AI** | 5 | Diffusion, VAEs, GANs |
| **Quantum Computing** | 5 | Bloch sphere, quantum gates, Grover's search |

Use the **category tabs** at the top of the catalog to filter by category. You
can further narrow results with:

- **Difficulty filters** -- toggle beginner, intermediate, or advanced tags.
- **Text search** -- type a keyword in the search bar to match algorithm names
  and descriptions.

Click any algorithm card to open its visualizer page.

## The Visualizer Page

Every algorithm page uses a **three-panel layout**:

1. **Canvas** (center) -- the main animation area where the algorithm plays out
   step by step. Data structures, model layers, and state transitions are
   rendered here.
2. **Code Panel** (left) -- displays the algorithm source with three switchable
   tabs: **Pseudocode**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**. The currently executing
   line is highlighted as you step through the visualization.
3. **Explanation Panel** (right) -- contains the algorithm **title**,
   a **plain-language explanation** of the current step, and a **state
   inspector** that shows live variable values and data-structure contents.

You can resize any panel by dragging the dividers between them.

## Playback Controls

The playback bar sits below the canvas. It contains, from left to right:

| Control | Icon | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reset | ⏮ | Jump to the very first step |
| Step Back | ◀ | Move one step backward |
| Play / Pause | ▶ / ⏸ | Start or pause continuous playback |
| Step Forward | ▶\| | Move one step forward |
| Speed | 0.5x / 1x / 2x / 4x | Choose the playback speed |
| Step counter | -- | Displays the current step number out of the total |
| Progress bar | -- | A scrubber you can drag to jump to any step |

Playback wraps around: when the animation reaches the last step and you press
**Step Forward**, the visualizer returns to step 1.

## Modifying Inputs

Below the code panel you will find the **input editor**. Each algorithm exposes
a set of configurable parameters (for example, the array to sort, the graph
adjacency list, or the learning rate).

1. Edit the parameter values directly in the input fields.
2. Alternatively, open the **Examples** dropdown to load a pre-built input set.
3. Press the **Run** button to regenerate the visualization with your new
   inputs.

The canvas, code highlights, and explanation panel all update to reflect the new
run.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can control playback without touching the mouse:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` | Play / Pause |
| `→` (Right Arrow) | Step forward |
| `←` (Left Arrow) | Step back |
| `Home` | Jump to first step |
| `End` | Jump to last step |
| `+` | Increase speed |
| `-` | Decrease speed |

## Educational Content

Each algorithm page includes a **Learn** section accessible via a tab or
scroll target below the visualizer. Inside you will find:

- **Key Concepts** -- a concise summary of the theory behind the algorithm,
  including time/space complexity and common use-cases.
- **Common Pitfalls** -- mistakes learners frequently make and how to avoid
  them.
- **Quiz** -- a short set of questions to test your understanding. Answers are
  revealed inline so you can self-check at your own pace.

Use the Learn section alongside the visualizer to build both intuition and
formal understanding of every algorithm Eigenvue covers.
