description: "Install the eigenvue Python package and use its four public functions to list algorithms, launch visualizations, and access step data programmatically."
---

The `eigenvue` Python package lets you launch the same interactive
visualizations you see on [eigenvue.web.app](https://eigenvue.web.app) -- directly from
your terminal, scripts, or notebooks.

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install eigenvue
```

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.10 or later
- The only runtime dependency is **Flask**, which is installed automatically

Verify the installation:

```python
import eigenvue

print(eigenvue.__version__)  # "0.1.0"
```

## Quick Start -- Listing Algorithms

Use `eigenvue.list()` to see every algorithm the package ships with:

```python
import eigenvue

algorithms = eigenvue.list()

for algo in algorithms:
    print(f"{algo['id']:30s} {algo['category']:20s} {algo['name']}")
```

`list()` returns a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains at minimum
the keys `id`, `name`, and `category` (`"classical"`, `"deep_learning"`, or
`"generative_ai"`).

## Quick Start -- Opening a Visualization

Call `eigenvue.show()` with an algorithm ID to launch the visualizer in your
default browser:

```python
import eigenvue

eigenvue.show("bubble-sort", data=[5, 3, 8, 1, 2])
```

A local Flask server starts in the background and serves the interactive
three-panel visualizer. The browser tab opens automatically. Press `Ctrl+C` in
the terminal to stop the server when you are done.

You can pass algorithm-specific keyword arguments (like `data` above) to
customise the input. If you omit them, sensible defaults are used.

## Programmatic Step Access

When you need raw step data -- for analysis, testing, or integration with other
tools -- use `eigenvue.steps()`:

```python
import eigenvue

frames = eigenvue.steps("binary-search", data=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], target=4)

print(f"Total steps: {len(frames)}")

for i, frame in enumerate(frames):
    print(f"Step {i}: {frame['description']}")
    print(f"  State: {frame['state']}")
```

`steps()` returns a list of frame dictionaries. Each frame includes:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | `str` | Plain-language explanation of the step |
| `state` | `dict` | A snapshot of all relevant variables at this point |
| `code_line` | `int` | The highlighted line number in the pseudocode |

This makes it straightforward to write assertions in tests, collect metrics, or
feed step data into your own visualisation pipeline.

## Type Safety

The package ships with a `py.typed` marker and full type hints on every public
function. If you use a type checker such as **mypy** or **Pyright**, you get
autocompletion and static analysis out of the box:

```python
# Your editor will infer the return type automatically.
frames: list[dict[str, object]] = eigenvue.steps("merge-sort", data=[9, 4, 7])
```

Type stubs are bundled inside the package -- no extra install is required.
