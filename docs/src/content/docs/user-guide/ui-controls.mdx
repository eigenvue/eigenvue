---

This page is a complete reference for the visualizer interface. Use it whenever
you need to know exactly what a button, panel, or shortcut does.

## Canvas Panel

The **canvas** occupies the centre of the visualizer page. It renders the
algorithm's data structures, model layers, or quantum circuit as an animated
graphic.

- **Pan** -- click and drag on empty space to move the viewport.
- **Zoom** -- scroll or pinch to zoom in and out.
- **Element tooltips** -- hover over any visual element (array cell, graph node,
  neural-network layer) to see its current value or label.
- **Highlight** -- the element being operated on in the current step is
  highlighted with an accent colour.

The canvas redraws on every step transition, whether driven by auto-playback or
manual stepping.

## Code Panel

The **code panel** sits to the left of the canvas. It shows the algorithm's
source code and highlights the line that corresponds to the current step.

### Tabs

Three tabs are available at the top of the panel:

| Tab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Pseudocode** | Language-agnostic notation that focuses on logic |
| **Python** | Idiomatic Python implementation |
| **JavaScript** | Idiomatic JavaScript implementation |

Switching tabs preserves the current step and line highlight. The highlighted
line maps to the equivalent operation in whichever language you select.

### Line Highlight

The active line is marked with a coloured background. As you step through the
algorithm, the highlight moves to follow execution. If the current step maps to
multiple lines (for example, a swap), all relevant lines are highlighted.

### Copy Button

A **Copy** icon in the top-right corner of the code panel copies the full source
listing for the active tab to your clipboard.

## Explanation Panel

The **explanation panel** sits to the right of the canvas and contains three
sections:

### Title

The algorithm name and a one-line summary (for example,
"Bubble Sort -- repeatedly swap adjacent elements that are out of order").

### Step Explanation

A plain-language description of what is happening at the current step. This
updates automatically as you advance or rewind. Example:

> Comparing elements at index 2 (value 7) and index 3 (value 1). Since 7 > 1,
> they will be swapped.

### State Inspector

A structured view of the algorithm's live variables. For a sorting algorithm
this might look like:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `array` | `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8]` |
| `i` | `2` |
| `j` | `3` |
| `swapped` | `true` |

For a neural-network visualization, the state inspector might show weight
matrices, activation values, or loss at the current training step.

## Playback Bar

The playback bar is a horizontal toolbar anchored below the canvas. Its controls
are laid out from left to right as described below.

### Reset Button (⏮)

Returns the visualization to **step 0** -- the initial state before any
operations have been performed.

### Step Back Button (◀)

Moves **one step backward**. If you are already at step 0, the button is
disabled. Holding the button does not auto-repeat; use the Play button for
continuous reverse is not supported -- step back manually.

### Play / Pause Button (▶ / ⏸)

Toggles continuous playback.

- **Play (▶)** -- the visualization advances one step at a time at the
  currently selected speed.
- **Pause (⏸)** -- playback stops and you remain on the current step.

When playback reaches the last step, it automatically pauses.

### Step Forward Button (▶|)

Moves **one step forward**. If you are already at the last step, the
visualization wraps around to step 0.

### Speed Selector

A dropdown or segmented control offering four presets:

| Speed | Delay Between Steps |
| --- | --- |
| **0.5x** | 2000 ms |
| **1x** | 1000 ms (default) |
| **2x** | 500 ms |
| **4x** | 250 ms |

The speed change takes effect immediately, even during active playback.

### Step Counter

Displays the current position in the format **Step N / Total**. For example,
`Step 12 / 45` tells you that you are on step 12 of 45 total steps.

### Progress Bar / Scrubber

A horizontal bar that fills proportionally as you move through the steps. You
can **click** anywhere on the bar or **drag** the thumb to jump directly to a
specific step. The canvas, code highlight, and explanation all update instantly
when you scrub.

## Input Editor

The input editor sits below the code panel. It exposes every configurable
parameter for the active algorithm.

- **Text fields / number inputs** -- type a value directly.
- **JSON editor** -- for complex inputs (arrays, objects, graphs) a multi-line
  editor with syntax highlighting is provided.
- **Examples dropdown** -- a pre-populated list of interesting inputs. Selecting
  one fills all fields automatically.
- **Run button** -- press to regenerate the visualization with the current
  inputs. The visualizer resets to step 0 with the new data.

Invalid inputs are highlighted in red with an inline error message.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

All shortcuts work when the visualizer page is focused. They mirror the
playback-bar buttons for faster navigation.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` | Play / Pause |
| `→` (Right Arrow) | Step forward |
| `←` (Left Arrow) | Step back |
| `Home` | Jump to first step (reset) |
| `End` | Jump to last step |
| `+` (or `=`) | Increase playback speed to the next preset |
| `-` | Decrease playback speed to the previous preset |

Keyboard shortcuts are disabled while the input editor text fields have focus,
so you can type freely without triggering playback actions.
