Every visualization state in Eigenvue is captured by a URL. This means you can
bookmark, share, or link to the exact step and input configuration you are
looking at.

## URL Structure

Visualization URLs follow this pattern:

```
https://eigenvue.web.app/algo/{algorithm-id}?{input-params}&step={N}
```

| Segment | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{algorithm-id}` | The unique slug for the algorithm | `bubble-sort` |
| `{input-params}` | URL-encoded input parameters | `data=[5,3,8,1]` |
| `step={N}` | The step number to jump to (0-indexed) | `step=12` |

A full example:

```
https://eigenvue.web.app/algo/bubble-sort?data=[5,3,8,1,2]&step=7
```

This opens the Bubble Sort visualizer, seeds it with the array `[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]`,
and jumps directly to step 7.

## Sharing a Specific State

The visualizer toolbar includes a **Share** button (link icon). Clicking it:

1. Constructs a URL that includes the current algorithm ID, all input parameters,
   and the current step number.
2. Copies the URL to your clipboard.
3. Displays a brief "Link copied" confirmation toast.

You can then paste the link into a chat message, email, forum post, or
learning-management system.

## Loading from a URL

When someone opens a shared URL, Eigenvue performs the following sequence:

1. **Parse the algorithm ID** from the path to determine which visualizer to
   load.
2. **Read query parameters** to extract input values (for example, `data`,
   `target`, `graph`, `start`).
3. **Run the step generator** with those inputs to produce the full list of
   animation frames.
4. **Jump to the step** specified by the `step` parameter. If the parameter is
   missing, playback starts from step 0.

The entire process takes only a moment. The recipient sees the exact same
visualization state the sender captured.

## Pre-computed vs Live Generation

Eigenvue generates step data **on the fly** in the browser. There is no
server-side pre-computation or caching of frames. This has two implications:

- **Deterministic algorithms** (most classical and deep-learning visualizations)
  always produce identical step sequences for the same inputs, so shared links
  are perfectly reproducible.
- **Stochastic algorithms** (some generative-AI visualizations that involve
  random sampling) may produce slightly different intermediate states on each
  run. The shared link preserves the inputs and the step number, but the
  animation may not be frame-identical. A seed parameter is available for
  algorithms where reproducibility matters.

## Social Sharing Previews

When you paste an Eigenvue URL into a platform that supports link previews
(Slack, Discord, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, iMessage, etc.), the page serves
**Open Graph (OG) meta tags** that produce a rich preview card:

- **Title** -- the algorithm name (for example, "Bubble Sort -- Eigenvue").
- **Description** -- a one-line summary of the algorithm.
- **Image** -- a generated preview image showing the canvas at the linked step.

These OG images are generated automatically so that every shared link looks
informative in social feeds and messaging apps, even before the recipient clicks
through.
